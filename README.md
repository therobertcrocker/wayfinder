## First Iteration

The primary focus of this initial phase is on the **Factions** module, providing functionalities such as:

- CRUD operations for factions and their assets.
- Association of factions with locations.
- Storage of factions and assets in a bbolt database.

## Future Plans

Once the MVP for the Factions module is complete, development will expand to include the following modules:

- **Core**: An event bus and messaging system with shared utilities.
- **Codex**: Manages the state of the world and various world entities, such as regions, locations, NPCs, timelines, and historical events.
- **Quests**: A tool for creating and managing in-world quests.
