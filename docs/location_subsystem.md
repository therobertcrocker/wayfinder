As for locations, I have three “levels” of the world I need to represent.

- The Astral Sea: essentially “space” though not nearly as large as our own. 
- The Astral Sea consists of 7 "Realms" that can only be crossed through access to a portal.
- Each Realm broken into disconnected regions that can only be accessed if a starship has a specific kind of jump drive. Within these regions are pockets of reality (which will serve as "planets" known as fragments. One of these fragments is known as "The Material Plane"
- the Material Plane: your traditional world map, consists of regions, and cities, and points of interest, etc 
- Fragments: essentially small planets that exist within the Astral Sea. They all have a central aesthetic and theme, and usually contain only a small number of POIs/towns.

I'm thinking of using a coordinate system that will look like "(AstralRealm)_(AstralRegion)_(Fragment)_(Location)" Ex: Core_Nexus_Material_The Citadel
