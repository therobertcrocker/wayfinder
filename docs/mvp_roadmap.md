     - [ ] Implement the Create operation and ensure the test passes.
     - [ ] Implement the Read operation and ensure the test passes.
     - [ ] Implement the Update operation and ensure the test passes.
     - [ ] Implement the Delete operation and ensure the test passes.
  - [ ] **Refactor Phase:** Review and refactor the CRUD code to ensure it's clean, readable, and maintainable.

## Codex Initialization

### User Story 2.1: As a Game Master, I want to design a subsystem for Locations within the Codex so that I can manage different locations in the game world.
**Tasks (TDD Loop):**

  - [ ] **Implementation Phase:** 
     - [ ] Define the structure for locations.
     - [ ] Implement methods to add, retrieve, and manage locations in the Codex.
     - [ ] Run the tests to ensure they pass.
  - [ ] **Refactor Phase:** Review and refactor the location management code to ensure it's clean and maintainable.

## Faction Management MVP

### User Story 3.1: As a Developer, I want to use the ECS framework for Factions and Assets so that I can manage different factions and their assets in the game.

     - [ ] Define the structure for factions and assets.
     - [ ] Implement methods to create, retrieve, and manage factions and assets.
     - [ ] Run the tests to ensure they pass.
  - [ ] **Refactor Phase:** Review and refactor the faction and asset management code to ensure it's clean and maintainable.

### User Story 3.2: As a Game Master, I want to establish relations between Factions, Assets, and the Codex so that I can create a cohesive game world.
**Tasks (TDD Loop):**
  - [ ] **Test Phase:** Write tests to ensure that relations between factions, assets, and the Codex can be established and managed.
  - [ ] **Implementation Phase:** 
     - [ ] Define the relationship structure between factions, assets, and the Codex.
     - [ ] Implement methods to establish and manage these relationships.
     - [ ] Run the tests to ensure they pass.
  - [ ] **Refactor Phase:** Review and refactor the relationship management code to ensure it's clean and maintainable.

## CLI Setup using Cobra

### User Story 4.1: As a Developer, I want to set up commands for CRUD operations of Factions and Assets so that I can manage them via the CLI.
**Tasks (TDD Loop):**
  - [ ] **Test Phase:** Write tests to ensure that CLI commands for CRUD operations of factions and assets work as expected.
  - [ ] **Implementation Phase:** 
     - [ ] Define CLI commands for creating, reading, updating, and deleting factions and assets.
     - [ ] Implement the commands using Cobra.
     - [ ] Run the tests to ensure they pass.
